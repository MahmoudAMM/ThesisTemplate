I'm Ahmed Mohamed Rashed Desoki, an assistant professor at Aerospace Engineering Department, Cairo University.

I created this thesis template to show you how you can create a professional thesis using Open Source Software (OSS).

I tried to cite all the sources that helped me create this sample.

If you face a problem, please try hard to read, learn and dig for a solution by yourself. In case you have suggestions, corrections, bugs or improvement, please send me a “pull request” at the Git page of this template at https://github.com/ahmed-rashed/ThesisTemplate.

This template should be available with you from the very beginning of your research. Whenever you find a new useful information, you should immediately write it in this document with clear citation.

Chapter 10 presents concise explanation to revision control using git.

Finally, foreign languages usually causes some problems to LaTeX documents. Arabic is not an exception. So if you faced a strange problem that you cannot solve, try disabling the Arabic parts of this thesis to check if the problem is related to the Arabic language (Mostly the problem is not specific to Arabic, but to several other languages as well.). To do so, just use the “Thesis_English.lyx” file. If disabling Arabic solved your problem, please try hard to find a solution and reactivate the Arabic again. Arabic scientists cannot help their nations using any language other than Arabic.
